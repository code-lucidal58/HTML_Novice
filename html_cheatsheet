## HTML cheatsheet

#### Validators 
[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/): The W3C validator checks the markup validity of various Web document formats, 
such as HTML.  
[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): The CSS validator checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML 
documents that use CSS stylesheets.
[Unicorn](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/): Unicorn is W3C's unified validator, which helps improve the quality of Web pages by performing a variety of 
checks. It gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as 
Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.

#### What is W3C?
W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.

#### Few W3C Standards
<p>Web accessibility means people with any disability or without any, both access web equally. Few things that support 
web accessibility are: proper page title, alt text in images, etc.</p>
<p>Internationalization means making web content available to any society, state, nation or organization. 
'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' 
and the 'n'. Unicode is a universal character set, ie. a standard that defines, in one place, all the characters needed 
for writing languages in use on computers. Some steps to support internationalization are: defining character set,

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
</head>
```
primary language declaration
```html
<html lang="fr">
```
</p>

#### HyperText
Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together. The idea was to "Mark Up" your document with links and 
define how to break it down into different segments (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.).
This lead to the definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate 
Hyperlinks in a text document. The metaphor of a Web is used to emphasize the importance of connections between 
documents. HTML's ancestor language is SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language),from which it borrowed the use of 
angle brackets.

#### Terms
**Elements** are pieces of a webpage. **Tags** are used to represent an element. They are case-insensitive. **Attributes** 
add meaning to tags and qualifies the element. These are case-sensitive. **Comments** in HTML are written as follows:
```html
<!-- this is a comment. Can be single line or multi line-->
```

#### First HTML page
The first thing in a html page is: `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This indicates that this is a HTML5 file. It is a document type 
declaration. The next tag will be `<html></html>`. This is where the document resides. The `<head></head>` tag inside `<html>` 
stores information about the document. `<body></body>` inside `<html>` stores the content of the document. `<p></p>` is used 
for paragraphs. `<q></<q>` is used for quotes. `<hr>` is for horizontal rule. Used for separate content types. 
`<blockquote></blockquote>` is for quoting larger passage. `<br>` is for line break. `<ul></ul> <ol></ol>` These are for 
unordered and ordered lists respectively. The list items are mentioned using `<li></li>`. `<pre></pre>` 
This is for preformatted text, mainly implies monospaced font. All whitespaces and formatting are shown as it is 
written between these tags.

#### Character Encoding
Each character is assigned a particular number called a **code point**. These code points are stored in computer memory 
in the form of bytes. We say the character is encoded using one or more bytes. Character encoding is used as a reference 
to map code points into bytes to store in computer memory. Examples of character encodings include:
* ASCII: contains letters, characters and a limited set of symbols and punctuation for the English language
* Windows-1252 (Latin1): Windows character set that supports 256 different code points
* ISO-8859-6: contains letters and symbols based on the Arabic script
* Unicode: contains characters for most living languages and scripts in the world

Always use the Unicode character encoding UTF-8 for web page.
`<meta>` tag is used to specify the character encoding. This tag is placed inside `<head>` tag. The meta declaration 
should be within the first 1024 bytes of the page.
```html
<meta charset="utf-8"> <!--OR-->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<!-- first one preferred-->
```

#### HTML character references
HTML reserves certain characters. All HTML character references can be written using either a name or number.

| Symbol | Entity Name | Entity Number |
|--------|-------------:|---------------:|
|Less than '<'|\&lt; | \&#60; | 
|Greater than '>'|\&gt;|\&#62;|
|Ampersand '&'|\&amp;|\&#38;|
|Quotes "|\&quot;|\&#34;|
|Non-breaking space - space that will not create a new line|\&nbsp;|\&#160;|

Entity name always starts with ampersand and ends with semi-colon. For a list of named character references available in 
HTML, visit:  https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref. Any Unicode character can be represented using a numeric 
character reference.

#### Some useful attributes
Attributes are name-value pair. The only exception is when it is of boolean type. If the attribute is mentioned, that 
means it is set to true. If omitted, it is set to false. `<ol reversed>` This will show the list in reverse. Order of 
attributes do not matter. There are two types of attributes:
**Global attributes** can be applied to any and all tags. E.g. id, class, lang, title, etc.
**Non Global attributes** are specific to a tag. E.g. src is specific to img and script.
* `start` attribute to `ol` indicates the starting number. `<ol start="5">` This is start numbering the list from 5. 

#### Semantics and Style
`<b>` and `<strong>`, `<i>` and `<em>` seem no different in a regular Web browser but there is an important difference 
between them. `<b>` and `<i>` are style tags, while `<em>` emphasises text and `<strong>` marks as important text. 
Hence the later two tags are semantics tags. Earlier two tags have no semantic meaning. This was the seen in HTML4. 
In HTML5, `lang` attribute was added to style tags to added semantic meaning.
<!--Unformatted-->
Linking to elements on the same page or to other pages on the same site is called navigation. HTML has a special tag called <nav> that is used to wrap these links in order to organize the content on your web page.

Some of the tags we have used, such as <div>, are called non-semantic tags. This means that they do not describe the content that is inside of them. However, many tags are used to describe the content that they surround, which helps us modify and style our content later. These are called semantic tags

<a href="/">Brown Bear</a>
web browsers respond to index.html and / the same way

The use of the 'scope' attribute, which can take one of two values:
row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
E.g. <th scope="col">Sunday</th>

<table border="2"></table>
This method of adding border is outdated. Please do not use it. This is for you to be able to understand other developer's code. The same effect can be achieved using CSS.

If the table contains data that spans multiple columns, use 'colspan' attribute in 'td' tag. Specify how many columns you want to cover.
E.g. <td colspan="2">Hello There! :)</td>
Similarly 'rowspan' features rows.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: <tbody>. The <tbody> element should contain the all of the table's data, excluding the table headings. Similarly <thead> and <tfoot> tags are used to add header and footer to table.
