### HTML CSS Inception
This repository is for recapitulation of basic syntaxes in use in HTML. It also contains small projects to illustrate 
execution of common HTML tags. Hope this helps people who have to often switch languages and are baffled by the varying 
styles of development. Keep rocking codes! ;)
